AWS IAM User Access Management (S3 & EC2 Access Demo)
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is used to create an IAM user and control access to AWS services.

The demonstration shows:

Creating an IAM user

Verifying that the user has no access by default

Granting full access to Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2

Confirming that the IAM user can successfully use S3 and EC2 after permissions are assigned

Screenshots are included as proof of each step.

🎯 Objective

Understand IAM user creation

Demonstrate default deny behavior in AWS

Show how permissions are granted using IAM policies

Verify service access from an IAM user account
